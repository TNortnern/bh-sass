# QA Testing Guide - December 2, 2025

**Date:** December 2, 2025
**Version:** 0.1.0 (Early Development)
**Platform:** BouncePro - Bounce House Rental SaaS

---

## Test Environment Access

| Service | URL | Purpose |
|---------|-----|---------|
| **Nuxt UI (Frontend)** | http://localhost:3005 | Main application interface |
| **Payload Admin** | http://localhost:3004/admin | CMS admin panel (platform operators) |

**Prerequisites:**
- Docker & Docker Compose installed

## IMPORTANT: Demo Mode (Non-Payment Testing)

### Enabling Demo Mode

For QA testing **WITHOUT real Stripe payments**, enable DEMO_MODE in your environment:

**In `docker-compose.yml`:**
```yaml
services:
  nuxt:
    environment:
      - DEMO_MODE=true
```

**Then restart services:**
```bash
docker compose restart nuxt
```

### What Demo Mode Does

- ✅ Bypasses Stripe payment processing
- ✅ Allows testing full booking flows without credit cards
- ✅ Marks bookings as `demo: true` in database
- ✅ Displays "DEMO MODE" indicator in booking UI
- ✅ Auto-confirms bookings without payment

### What Demo Mode DOES NOT Do

- ❌ Does NOT test actual Stripe integration
- ❌ Does NOT process real payments
- ❌ Does NOT validate credit card information
- ❌ Does NOT create Stripe customer records

### When to Use Demo Mode

**Use Demo Mode for:**
- Testing booking flows
- Verifying date availability logic
- Testing email notifications
- UI/UX testing
- Customer journey validation
- Inventory sync testing

**Do NOT Use Demo Mode for:**
